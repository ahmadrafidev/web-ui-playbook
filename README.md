# Web UI Playbook

*A comprehensive guide for creating consistent, accessible, and user-friendly UI components.*

</div>

## Motivation

When I started coding UI components, I quickly realized I had no idea how to build them properly. Questions about scalability, best practices, and accessibility constantly plagued my development process. I knew my components worked functionally, but I had little confidence they were built well or would stand the test of time and real-world usage.

This uncertainty led me to explore how the industry's most established companies approach component design. I dove deep into the design systems of Google, Apple, Microsoft, Atlassian, and Shopify, hoping to understand not just what they built, but how and why they built it that way. Each system offered valuable insights, yet I found myself jumping between different documentation sites, trying to piece together a complete picture of component best practices.

The Web UI Playbook emerged from this research as my attempt to synthesize these learnings into a single, comprehensive resource. Instead of developers having to hunt across multiple design systems to understand how to build robust, accessible components, I wanted to create a centralized collection that distills the collective wisdom of these industry leaders. The goal is to document not just the what, but the how and why behind effective component design.

This is very much a learning exercise for me, and I'm certain there are gaps and oversights that more experienced practitioners would spot immediately. I'm hoping others will contribute their expertise to make this resource more complete and useful for anyone facing the same challenges I encountered when trying to build better UI components.
